\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classBallot}{Ballot} \\*Necessary functionality to represent a voter\textquotesingle{}s ballot in an election. It is able to represent ballots in both plurality and single-\/tranferrable vote elections. A ballot had an Id, a list of the Candidates in the order they were ranked on the ballot, and a variable indicating the current highest ranked \hyperlink{classCandidate}{Candidate} choice remaining on the ballot }{\pageref{classBallot}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classCandidate}{Candidate} \\*Necessary functionality to represent a candidate in an election. It is able to represent candidates in both plurality and single-\/tranferrable vote elections. A \hyperlink{classCandidate}{Candidate} had an Id, a name, a forward-\/linked list of \hyperlink{classBallot}{Ballot} objects assigned to them, a int representing the count of how many Ballots are assigned to them, double representing the time of when they received their first \hyperlink{classBallot}{Ballot} in an election (needed for S\+TV elections), and boolean indicating whether the \hyperlink{classCandidate}{Candidate} has been declared a winner or a loser yet }{\pageref{classCandidate}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classElection}{Election} \\*Abstract class that provides the necessary functionality to represent an election. While non-\/abstract child classes are required to implement their own \hyperlink{classBallot}{Ballot} tallying algorithms and results, the \hyperlink{classElection}{Election} class provides a template of necessary methods and properties that all types of elections will utilize }{\pageref{classElection}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classPluralityElection}{Plurality\+Election} \\*Child class of the abstract \hyperlink{classElection}{Election} class that provides the necessary functionality to represent a Plurality election }{\pageref{classPluralityElection}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classSTVElection}{S\+T\+V\+Election} \\*Child class of the abstract \hyperlink{classElection}{Election} class that provides the necessary functionality to represent a Single-\/\+Transferrable Vote (ranked choice) election using the Droop algorithm. On top of all of the properties of the \hyperlink{classElection}{Election} class, the \hyperlink{classSTVElection}{S\+T\+V\+Election} class also has a value for the Droop quota, a value indicating whether to turn the \hyperlink{classBallot}{Ballot} shuffle on/off, and a vector that stores the order of the shuffled \hyperlink{classBallot}{Ballot} objects for the election }{\pageref{classSTVElection}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classVotingApp}{Voting\+App} \\*Necessary functionality to run the user interface for the application. It handles all interactions with the user in the interface and initiates the process of running an election after being given all the necessary information by the user. It also provides the necessary functionality to run in a test mode for debugging purposes }{\pageref{classVotingApp}}{}
